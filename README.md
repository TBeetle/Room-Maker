# TheBackyardigans

Our project will be a Web application that can ingest a JSON or Excel/CSV file to draw a building layout. The output of the app would be both a downloadable LaTeX file and PDF of the finished drawing. Users would be able to adjust items live in the browser (e.g. shift a wall around, move a chair) with a flexible UI. Style settings would be controlled in the app, and it would be built using Django and Materialize-CSS. A bonus feature would allow for an upload of a PDF building plan that auto-converts walls/doors/windows to LaTeX.

## External Requirements

List all the stuff the reader will need to install in order to get you app to
run in their laptop. For example:

In order to build this project you first have to install:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

If possible, list the actual commands you used to install these, so the reader
can just cut-n-paste the commands and get everything setup.

You only need to add instructions for the OS you are using.

## Setup

Here you list all the one-time things the developer needs to do after cloning
your repo. Sometimes there is no need for this section, but some apps require
some first-time configuration from the developer, for example: setting up a
database for running your webapp locally.

## Running

Specify the commands for a developer to run the app from the cloned repo.

# Deployment

** Note ** - Railway costs $5 per month; possible alternatives [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) (beginner tier is free)
Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
. Note that you **do not put passwords in git**.

Mobile apps will also sometimes need some instructions on how to build a
"release" version, maybe how to sign it, and how to run that binary in an
emulator or in a physical phone.

# Testing

In 492 you will write automated tests. When you do you will need to add a
section that explains how to run them.

The unit tests are in `/test/unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/test/casper/`.

## Testing Technology

In some cases you need to install test runners, etc. Explain how.

## Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests.
